        <p class="content">Writing the ‘About Me’ section of any blog, website or profile always feels like a bit of a job interview, but with an online dating twist to it.  So as we start this relationship, which I hope will be a long and happy one, I thought I would let you know a little bit about myself: Who I am, Where I’m from, and Why I think you will enjoy reading my golf travel blog</P>
        <p class="content">Many people think the ‘About Me’ page on a blog is too static, especially for someone who is traveling and learning new things all the time, but here are some things about me, which I don’t think are going to change any time soon</p>
        <p class="bulk">I am from Cape Town, on the South Western tip of both South Africa and the African continent.  While the little green book we call the South African Passport is not always the best travel companion, I have been able to feed my addiction for travel and see many amazing places around the World. I’ve also been able to play golf on six of the seven continents, so it is only a matter of time until I make the trip to Antarctica!</p>
        <p class="bulk">Since starting this blog a couple of years ago I have finally come in off the road, the years of overland guiding providing me with so many amazing memories, experiences and friends.  Fortunately I was able to find a job within in the industry and am now working in Cape Town for a Safari Operator.  I think I may also have dropped a stroke on my handicap to a 12, but still only play once a month, so it doesn’t leave much time for improvement.</P>
        <p class="ending">I’m still as social a golfer as ever and just love being out there. Whether it is on a new course in a new country or one of favourites here in Cape Town, it’s great to just be playing.  Now that I am in Cape Town though, I will hopefully be bringing you The Shoestring Golfer’s insight into budget golf in the Mother City.</p>
